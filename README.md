VROOMSKI RENTS | SIMPLE VEHICLE RENTAL SYSTEM 

Using Java and Xammp (phpmyadmin) as the primary programming language and a highly reliable database for data storage, the application ensures complete security, data integrity, and system scalability. Currently, in such a fast environment, vehicle rental businesses need a reliable system for operation. Traditional manual methods often have too many chances of errors, inefficiencies, and delays in service. The Vehicle Rental System addresses these difficulties by providing a digital solution that automates the logic for managing vehicle availability, rental history, and client contacts.
